<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>William G. Lycan, <i>Real Conditionals</i>.
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2001, 233 pages, hardback, ?25<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>Over the last two decades, William Lycan?s
work on the semantics of conditionals has been distinguished by his careful
attention to the connection between syntax and semantics, and more generally by
his impeccible methodology. Lycan takes compositionality seriously, so in his
theory the meaning of ?even if?, for example, should be a combination of the
meaning of ?even? and the meaning of ?if?. After reading his work, it?s hard to
take seriously work which does not share this methodology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>Lycan?s
semantics for conditionals makes central use of what he calls ?events?. An
event is not a possible world, for it need not be complete or consistent. It is
more like what Barwise and Perry call a ?situation?. Conditionals are
quantifiers over events, as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>P
if Q = P in any event in which Q</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>P
only if Q = P in no event other than one in which Q</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>P
even if Q = P in any event including any in which Q (17)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB>The quantifiers here are contextually
restricted. Lycan includes in the semantic analysis a predicate of events <i>R</i>,
whose role is to restrict the quantifiers over events. An event satisfies <i>R</i>
only if it is ?envisaged?, which is similar to saying it is a ?real? or ?relevant?
possibility. The value of <i>R</i> changes frequently; sometimes it even
changes mid-sentence. This fact is appealed to frequently in explaining some
surprising behaviour of conditionals. For example, the invalidity of
antecedent-strengthening: <i>if p then r</i>, <i>so if p and q then r</i>, is
explained by saying the class of events relevant to the truth of the conclusion
may be larger than the class of events relevant to the truth of the premise. In
particular, at least one event in which <i>p</i> <i>and q</i> is relevant to
the conclusion, but no such event need be relevant to the premise. A similar
explanation is given for the failure of transitivity and contraposition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>The
quantifier domain must include some non-actual events or conditionals will turn
into material implications. Surprisingly, Lycan says that sometimes the
quantifier includes only non-actual events. In these cases, it is possible that
all (relevant) <i>p</i>-events can be <i>q</i>-events, even though <i>p</i> is
true but not <i>q</i>. That is, in these cases modus ponens is invalid. Lycan
argues persuasively that the case against modus ponens is at least as strong as
the case against antecedent-strengthening, contraposition and modus tollens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>There
is an extended discussion of ?even?, which is necessary for providing a theory
of ?even if?. Lycan first suggests that <i>Even Grannie was sober</i> means <i>Everyone,
including Grannie</i>, <i>was sober</i>. The quantifier domain includes
everyone no less likely than Grannie to be sober. After discussing some
counterexamples, Lycan suggests that instead it means <i>Everyone plus Grannie
was sober</i>, where the quantifer ranges over everyone whom you would expect
to be sober. Lycan is committed to ?even? being a quantifier because of its
syntactic similarity to ?only?, and because of the ?initial plausibility of ?
universally quantified paraphrases? (121) of sentences involving ?even?. The
discussion here is fascinating, but not conclusive. It isn?t clear, for
example, that ?even? and ?only? have the same syntactic role. Compare <i>Even
supposing Jack were here, he wouldn?t help</i> with *<i>Only supposing Jack
were here, he wouldn?t help</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>Lycan
also includes a helpful discussion of how his theory handles Allan Gibbard?s
?Riverboat Puzzle? and related cases. It is troubling, for those who don?t
analyse conditionals as material implications, that sometimes one speaker can
say <i>If p, q</i>, another can say <i>If p, not q</i>, and both seem to be
speaking truly. Lycan argues we should accept this troubling consequence, but
explain it by making <i>R</i> sensitive to epistemic considerations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>As
well as these points, Lycan raises some powerful objections to ?No Truth Value?
theories of conditionals, and against the extensive use of probability theory
in semantics. The book concludes with two appendicies on ?non-conditional?
conditionals, such as <i>If you?re hungry, there?s biscuits on the sideboard</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>There?s
a lot to like about this book, not least it?s witty, even charming, style.
Lycan considers more examples, from more diverse sources, than most writers.
The theory he presents is innovative and at least aims to be comprehensive. And
of course there are some good arguments for it. Despite this there are, as
always, occasional grounds for complaint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>Although
Lycan is very careful to get the syntax of ?if? right, and proves that unlike
?and? and ?or? it is not a co-ordinating conjunction, it is not so clear that
the syntactic evidence provides distinctive support for his semantic theory. If
it?s consistent with the syntax to say <i>p if q</i> means <i>All relevant
q-events are p-events</i>, it?s consistent with the syntax to say that it means
<i>All nearby q-worlds are p-worlds</i>. So the syntactic argument for
preferring Lycan?s theory, to, say, Stalnaker?s, is not obviously overpowering.
Lycan suggests that we can naturally paraphrase conditionals as quantifications
over events, but since he is using <i>event</i> ?in a slightly uncommon way?
(17) it is not obvious what support this gives for his theory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>There
are few reasons to favour the use of events rather than worlds in the analysis.
The fact that events can be incomplete seems to only cause complications for
the theory. The fact that they can be inconsistent is used to rescue some
intuitions about conditionals with impossible antecedents, but many would argue
those intuitions should be discarded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>But
the main worry is that Lycan needs to say more about some key notions,
particularly about his <i>R</i> and about validity. In the discussion of the
Riverboat Puzzle, Lycan says, ?I do not have a good enough intuitive handle on
my own notion of ?relevance? to provide a crushing answer [to a question about
why certain events are not covered by <i>R</i>].? (173)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">? </span>Lycan says that for an event to be <i>R</i>,
?the utterer must have it at least tacitly in mind as a live prospect.? (19)
All events in <i>R</i> are ?envisaged?, to use the term he lands on. But ?there
is somethig slightly artificial or stylized about ?envisaging? ? ?Envisaging?
is not a purely <i>de facto</i> cognitive or other psychological state.? (30)
The upshot is that the envisaged possibilities are some, but not always all, of
those that are (possibly tacitly) regarded as live. Just which possibilities
then? We are never given a specific account. Any account we do get is, as in
the above quote, almost immediately qualified. Since <i>R</i> does so much
work, the reader is probably owed a little more here. (This point is made at
greater length in Ken Turner?s excellent review of <i>Real Conditionals</i> in
the <i>Journal of Pragmatics</i> forthcoming.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>We
are also never specifically given an account of validity. We are told that
several argument forms, from antecedent-strengthening to modus ponens, are
invalid. This seems to mean that one could assert their premises then reject,
or a least decline to assert, their conclusion. It?s important that this
process of assertion and rejection take place in real time, because the value
of <i>R</i> needs to change for the arguments to be invalid. Lycan has some
arguments that this conception of validity is the philosophically interesting
one, but this deserves more treatment. The logical reforms it draws in go well
beyond the logic of conditionals. On Lycan?s approach, <i>All swans are white,
so all Australian swans are white</i> is, presumably, invalid, since the scope
of the quantifier could change from premise to conclusion. And contraposition
fails for valid arguments. Contraposed modus ponens: <i>p, not q, so not if p,
q</i> is valid, but modus ponens is not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>??????????? </span>None
of this is to deny that <i>Real Conditionals</i> is a great contribution to the
literature, and if it causes more theorists to pay serious attention to Lycan?s
Event Theory, that would be an excellent consequence.</span></p>
