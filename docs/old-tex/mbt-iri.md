# Blome-Tillmann on Interest-Relative Invariantism

Michael Blome-Tillmann has argued that his version of Lewisian
contextualism is preferable to interest-relative invariantism
[@MBT2009][^1]. There are three main arguments offered, one from modal
embeddings, one from temporal embeddings and one from deviant
conjunctions. I don't think any of these work, for reasons that I'll go
through in turn.

## Modal Embeddings

Jason Stanley had argued that the fact that interest-relative
invariantism (hereafter, IRI) has counterintuitive consequences when it
comes to knowledge ascriptions in modal contexts shouldn't count too
heavily against IRI, because contextualist approaches are similarly
counterintuitive. In particular, he argues that the theory that 'knows'
is a contextually sensitive quantifier, plus the account of
quantifier-domain restriction that he developed with Zoltán Gendler
Szabó [@Stanley2000-STAOQD], has false implications when it is applied
to knowledge ascriptions in counterfactuals. Blome-Tillmann disagrees,
but I don't think he provides very good reasons for disagreeing. Let's
start by reviewing how we got to this point.

Often when we say *All Fs are Gs*, we really mean *All C Fs are Gs*,
where $C$ is a contextually specified property. So when I say *Every
student passed*, that utterance might express the proposition that every
student **in my class** passed. Now there's a question about what
happens when sentences like *All Fs are Gs* are embedded in various
contexts. The question arises because quantifier embeddings tend to
allow for certain kinds of ambiguity. For instance, when we have a
sentence like *If p were true, all Fs would be G*, that could express
either of the following two propositions. (We're ignoring context
sensitivity for now, but we'll return to it in a second.)

-   If $p$ were true, then everything that would be $F$ would also be
    $G$.

-   If $p$ were true, then everything that's actually $F$ would be $G$.

We naturally interpret (1) the first way, and (2) the second way.

Given this, you might expect that we could get a similar ambiguity with
$C$. That is, when you have a quantifier that's tacitly restricted by
$C$, you might expect that you could interpret a sentence like *If p
were true, all Fs would be G* in either of these two ways. (In each of
these interpretations, I've left $F$ ambiguous; it might denote the
actual $F$s or the things that would be $F$ if $p$ were true. So these
are just partial disambiguations.)

-   If $p$ were true, then every $F$ that would be $C$ would also be
    $G$.

-   If $p$ were true, then every $F$ that is actually $C$ would be $G$.

Surprisingly, it's hard to get the second of these readings. Or, at
least, it is hard to *avoid* the availability of the first reading.
Typically, if we restrict our attention to the $C$s, then when we embed
the quantifier in the consequent of a counterfactual, the restriction is
to the things that would be $C$, not to the actual $C$s.[^2]

Blome-Tillmann notes that Stanley makes these observations, and
interprets him as moulding them into the following argument against
Lewisian contextualism.

1.  An utterance of *If p were true, all Fs would be Gs* is interpreted
    as meaning *If p were true, then every F that would be C would also
    be G*.

2.  Lewisian contextualism needs an utterance of *If p were true, then S
    would know that q* to be interpreted as meaning *If p were true,
    then S's evidence would rule out all $\neg$q possibilities, except
    those that are actually being properly ignored*, i.e. it needs the
    contextually supplied restrictor to get its extension from the
    nature of the actual world.

3.  So, Lewisian contextualism is false.

And Blome-Tillmann argues that the first premise of this argument is
false. He thinks that he has examples which undermine premise 1. But I
don't think his examples show any such thing. Here are the examples he
gives. (I've altered the numbering for consistency with this paper.)

These are all sentences of (more or less) the form *If p were true, Det
Fs would be G*, where $Det$ is some determiner or other, and they should
all be interpreted a la our second disambiguation above. That is, they
should be interpreted as quantifying over actual $F$s, not things that
would be $F$ if $p$ were true. But the existence of such sentences is
completely irrelevant to what's at issue in premise 1. The question
isn't whether there is an ambiguity in the $F$ position, it is whether
there is an ambiguity in the $C$ position. And nothing Blome-Tillmann
raises suggests premise 1 is false. So this response doesn't work.

Even if a Lewisian contextualist were to undermine premise 1 of this
argument, they wouldn't be out of the woods. That's because premise 1 is
much stronger than is needed for the anti-contextualist argument Stanley
actually runs. Note first that the Lewisian contextualist needs a
reading of *If p were true, all Fs would be G* where it means:

-   If $p$ were true, every actual $C$ that would be $F$ would also be
    $G$.

The reason the Lewisian contextualist needs this reading is that on
their story, *S knows that p* means *Every $\neg p$ possibility is ruled
out by S's evidence*, where the *every* has a contextual domain
restriction, and the Lewisian focuses on the actual context. The effect
in practice is that an utterance of *S knows that p* is true just in
case every $\neg p$ possibility that the speaker isn't properly
ignoring, i.e., isn't actually properly ignoring, is ruled out by $S$'s
evidence. Lewisian contextualism is meant to explain sceptical
intuitions, so let's consider a particular sceptical intuition. Imagine
a context where:

-   I'm engaged in sceptical doubts;

-   there is beer in the fridge

-   I've forgotten what's in the fridge; and

-   I've got normal vision, so if I check the fridge I'll see what's in
    it.

In that context it seems (6) is false, since it would only be true if
Cartesian doubts weren't salient.

But the only way to get that to come out false, and false for the right
reasons, is to fix on which worlds we're actually ignoring (i.e.,
include in the quantifier domain worlds where I'm the victim of an evil
demon), but look at worlds that would be ruled out with the
counterfactually available evidence. We don't want the sentence to be
false because I've actually forgotten what's in the fridge. And we don't
want it to be true because I would be ignoring Cartesian possibilities.
In the terminology above, we would need *If p were true, all Fs would be
Gs* to mean *If p were true, then every actual C that were F would also
be G*. We haven't got any reason yet to think that's even a *possible*
disambiguation of (6).

But let's make things easy for the contextualist and assume that it is.
Stanley's point is that the contextualist needs even more than this.
They need it to be by far the *preferred* disambiguation, since in the
context I describe the natural reading of (6) (given sceptical
intuitions) is that it is false because my looking in the fridge
wouldn't rule out Cartesian doubts. And they need it to be the preferred
reading even though there are alternative readings that are (a) easier
to describe, (b) of a kind more commonly found, and (c) true. Every
principle of contextual disambiguation we have pushes us away from
thinking this is the preferred disambiguation. This is the deeper
challenge Stanley raises for contextualists, and it hasn't yet been
solved.

## Temporal Embeddings

Blome-Tillmann thinks that IRI will lead to implausible consequences
with temporal embeddings. He illustrates this with a variant of the
well-known bank cases. (I assume familiarity with these cases among my
readers.) Let $O$ be that the bank is open Saturday morning. If Hannah
has a large debt, she is in a high-stakes situation with respect to $O$.
She had in fact incurred a large debt, but on Friday morning the
creditor waived this debt. Hannah had no way of anticipating this on
Thursday. She has some evidence for $O$, but not enough for knowledge if
she's in a high-stakes situation. Blome-Tillmann says that this means
after Hannah discovers the debt waiver, she could say (7).

But I'm not sure why this case should be problematic. As Blome-Tillmann
notes, it isn't really a situation where Hannah's stakes change. She was
never actually in a high stakes situation. At most her perception of her
stakes change; she thought she was in a high-stakes situation, then
realised that she wasn't. Blome-Tillmann argues that even this change in
perceived stakes can be enough to make (7) true if IRI is true. I agree
that this change in perception could be enough to make (7) true, but
when we work through the reason that's so, we'll see that it isn't
because of anything distinctive, let alone controversial, about IRI.

If Hannah is rational, then given her interests she won't be ignoring
$\neg O$ possibilities on Thursday. She'll be taking them into account
in her plans. Someone who is anticipating $\neg O$ possibilities, and
making plans for them, doesn't know $O$. That's not a distinctive claim
of IRI. Any theory should say that if a person is worrying about
$\neg O$ possibilities, and planning around them, they don't know $O$.
If Hannah is rational, that will describe her on Thursday, but not on
Friday. So (7) is true not because Hannah's practical situation changes
between Thursday and Friday, but because her psychological state
changes.

What if Hannah is, on Thursday, irrationally ignoring $\neg O$
possibilities, and not planning for them even though her rational self
wishes she were planning for them? Then Hannah has irrational attitudes
towards $O$, and anyone who has irrational attitudes towards $O$ doesn't
know $O$, since knowledge requires a greater level of rationality than
Hannah shows here. The principle from the last sentence can lead to some
quirky results for reasons independent of IRI, and this could trip us up
if we spend too much time on particular cases, and too little on
epistemological theory.

So consider Bobby. Bobby has the disposition to infer $\neg B$ from
$A \rightarrow B$ and $\neg A$. He currently has good inductive evidence
for $q$, and infers $q$ on that basis. But he also knows
$p \rightarrow q$ and $\neg p$. If he notices that he has these pieces
of knowledge, he'll infer $\neg q$. This inferential disposition defeats
any claim he might have to *know* $q$; the inferential disposition is a
kind of doxastic defeater. Then Bobby sits down with some truth tables
and talks himself out of the disposition to infer $\neg B$ from
$A \rightarrow B$ and $\neg A$. He now knows $q$ although he didn't know
it earlier, when he had irrational attitudes towards a web of
propositions including $q$. And that's true even though his evidence for
$q$ didn't change.[^3]

Bobby's case is parallel to the case where Hannah irrationally ignores
the significance of $O$ to her practical deliberation. In both cases,
defective mental states elsewhere in their cognitive architecture defeat
knowledge claims. And in that kind of case, we should expect sentences
like (7) to be true, even if they appear counterintuitive before we've
worked through the details.

## Conjunctions

George and Ringo both have \$6000 in their bank accounts. They both are
thinking about buying a new computer, which would cost \$2000. Both of
them also have rent due tomorrow, and they won't get any more money
before then. George lives in New York, so his rent is \$5000. Ringo
lives in Syracuse, so his rent is \$1000. Clearly, (8) and (9) are true.

And (10) is true as well, though there's at least a reading of (11)
where it is false.

Focus for now on (10). It is a bad idea for George to buy the computer;
he won't be able to pay his rent. But he has enough money to do so; the
computer costs \$2000, and he has \$6000 in the bank. So (10) is true.
Admittedly there are things close to (10) that aren't true. He hasn't
got enough money to buy the computer and pay his rent. You might say
that he hasn't got enough money to buy the computer given his other
financial obligations. But none of this undermines (10). The point of
this little story is to respond to an argument Blome-Tillmann makes
towards the end of his paper. Here is how he puts the argument. (Again
I've changed the numbering and some terminology for consistency with
this paper.)

> Suppose that John and Paul have exactly the same evidence, while John
> is in a low-stakes situation towards $p$ and Paul in a high-stakes
> situation towards $p$. Bearing in mind that IRI is the view that
> whether one knows $p$ depends on one's practical situation, IRI
> entails that one can truly assert:

And this is meant to be a problem, because (12) is intuitively false.

But IRI doesn't entail any such thing. Paul does have enough evidence to
know that $p$, just like George has enough money to buy the computer.
Paul can't know that $p$, just like George can't buy the computer,
because of their practical situations. But that doesn't mean he doesn't
have enough evidence to know it. So, contra Blome-Tillmann, IRI doesn't
entail this problematic conjunction.

In a footnote attached to this, Blome-Tillmann tries to reformulate the
argument.

> I take it that having enough evidence to 'know $p$' in $C$ just means
> having evidence such that one is in a position to 'know $p$' in $C$,
> rather than having evidence such that one 'knows $p$'. Thus, another
> way to formulate (12) would be as follows: 'John and Paul have exactly
> the same evidence for $p$, but only John is in a position to know $p$,
> Paul isn't.'

The 'reformulation' is obviously bad, since having enough evidence to
know $p$ isn't the same as being in a position to know it, any more than
having enough money to buy the computer puts George in a position to buy
it. But might there be a different problem for IRI here? Might it be
that IRI entails (13), which is false?

There isn't a problem with (13) because almost any epistemological
theory will imply that conjunctions like that are true. In particular,
any epistemological theory that allows for the existence of defeaters to
not supervene on the possession of evidence will imply that conjunctions
like (13) are true. Any such theory, or indeed any such
non-supervenience claim, will be controversial. But there are so many
plausible violations of this supervenience principle, that it would be
implausible if none of them work. Here are three putative examples of
cases where subjects have the same evidence but different defeaters; I
expect most epistemologists will find at least one of them plausible.

I'm actually not sure what plausible theory would imply that what
different agents are in a position to know depends on *nothing* except
for what evidence they have. The only theory that I can imagine with
that consequence is the conjunction of evidentialism about justification
and a justified true belief theory of knowledge. So really there's no
reason to think that implying sentences like (13) is a mark against a
theory.

It's been suggested to me[^4] that there are other more problematic
conjunctions in the neighbourhood. For instance, we might worry that IRI
implies that (14) is true.

That would be problematic, but there's no reason to think IRI implies
it. Indeed, IRI entails that the first conjunct is false, since John and
Paul are unlike in one respect that IRI loudly insists is relevant.
Perhaps we can do better with (15).

That is something IRI implies, but it seems more than a little
question-begging to use its alleged counterintuitiveness against IRI.
After all, it's simply a statement of IRI itself. If someone had alleged
that IRI should be accepted because it was so intuitive, I guess noting
how odd (15) looks would be a response to them. But that's not the way
IRI is defended in the books and papers I cited in the introduction. It
is defended by noting what a good job it does of handling difficult
puzzles, especially puzzles concerning lotteries and conjunctions, and I
don't see any reason to think there is any solution to those puzzles
that isn't counterintuitive.

On a more positive note, I think it will be worthwhile going forward to
think about 'afford' in these debates, since 'afford' is
interest-relative, at least on one disambiguation. A kind of Lewisian
contextualism about 'afford' would be crazy. We shouldn't say that if my
rent is \$5000, and it is due tomorrow, then (9) is false, because after
all, in my context someone with Ringo's money couldn't buy the computer
and meet their financial obligations. So there might be some interesting
patterns that 'afford' has, and checking whether 'knows' behaves the
same way could be a good check on whether 'knows' is interest-relative.

[^1]: Blome-Tillmann calls interest-relative invariantism
    'subject-sensitive invariantism'. This is an unfortunate moniker.
    The only subject-*insensitive* theory of knowledge has that for any
    $S, T$ $S$ knows that $p$ iff $T$ knows that $p$. The view
    Blome-Tillmann is targetting, as set out in @Fantl2002
    [@Hawthorne2004; @Stanley2005-STAKAP] and @Weatherson2005-WEACWD
    certainly isn't defined in opposition to *this* generalisation. The
    canonical source for Lewisian contextualism is @Lewis1996b, and
    Blome-Tillmann defends a variant in @MBT2009a.

[^2]: See @Stanley2000-STAOQD and @Stanley2005-STAKAP for arguments to
    this effect.

[^3]: I assume, what shouldn't be controversial, that irrational
    inferential dispositions which the agent does not know he has, and
    which he does not apply, are not part of his evidence.
